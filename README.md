\cf2 The bulk of the project is a large conductive textile (made via knitting machine) hooked up to an Intel Galileo. This web app will be projected onto the textile, and will display different letters and make different sounds based on touch. Ara currently does not speak, but we hope that with constant repetitions of each letter, she will learn to pronounce some letters and eventually learn words.\

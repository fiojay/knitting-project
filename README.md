================

This is an application designed to facilitate the interaction of a child diagnosed with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with her loved ones, and also to help teach her the alphabet and speech. We are focusing on a little girl named Ara.

The bulk of this project is a large conductive textile (made via knitting machine) hooked up to an Intel Galileo. This web app with be projected onto the textile, and will display different letters and make different sounds based on touch. Ara currently does not speak, but we hope that with constant repetitions of each letter, she will learn to pronounce some letters and eventually learn words.
